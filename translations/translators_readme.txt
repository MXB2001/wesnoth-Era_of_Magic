If you want to translate the add-on, follow these instructions:

1. Download Poedit (this is a free editor for translating apps)
https://poedit.net/download

2. Open EoMa_raw_translation_file.po (usually located in add-ons/Era_of_Magic/translations/

3. Choose your language via settings

4. Start translating (the user interface is very easy to master)

5. When finished, export .mo file and share it on the forums in this topic:
https://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=20039

so I can release it officially.

All translators will be mentioned in the add-on's credits.

**Translation tips for experienced translators:**

If you already translated portions of the addon in the past, you can use Poedit's translation memory to quickly fill the .po file instead of writing everything from scratch. To do so:
1) navigate to Catalogue->Pre-translate
2) in a new window pick only the last checkbox and hit "Pre-translate" button
3) the application will automatically populate all known phrases with proper translations
4) sometimes these automatically proposed strings may be inaccurate, verify everything twice, correct when necessary

Happy translating!
